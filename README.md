# Team-of-the-Tournament-WT20--2022
Team of the Tournament revealed for Men's T20 World Cup 2022

Description:
I undertook a project to select the best team for the 2022 T20 World Cup. The project involved multiple stages and utilized web scraping, data cleaning, and data analysis techniques. Here's a breakdown of the project's key components:

    Data Source: I gathered cricket statistics and player information from the ESPNCricinfo website for the T20 World Cup in 2022.

    Data Collection: I utilized JavaScript for web scraping to collect comprehensive data on players' performance, including batting and bowling statistics, match history, and other relevant information.

    Data Transformation: I processed the scraped data and organized it into structured Excel datasets. This involved parsing, formatting, and structuring the raw data for analysis.

    Data Cleaning: To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, I implemented data cleaning techniques. This step involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting any inconsistencies in the datasets.

    Player Selection: I used specific criteria, such as performance metrics, player rankings, and historical records, to identify and select the best players for the T20 World Cup team.

    Dashboard Creation: To present the team selection and player statistics effectively, I designed and created a dashboard using data visualization tools or libraries (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, or custom JavaScript libraries).

This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in web scraping, data analysis, and data visualization but also showcases my ability to work with real-world data to make informed decisions, a valuable skill for data-driven roles.
